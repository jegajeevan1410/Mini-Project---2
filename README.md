PhonePe Transaction Insights
📊 PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis
Welcome to the PhonePe Pulse Analysis project!
This project provides comprehensive insights into PhonePe's transaction data using aggregated, map-based, and top category analyses.
It is designed to explore and visualize trends in digital payments across India based on the open-source data made available by PhonePe Pulse.

📚 Project Overview
PhonePe Pulse provides transaction and user metrics in three main formats:

Aggregated Data (Transaction/Users summarized)

Map Data (State/District-wise visualization)

Top Data (Top-performing states, districts, pincodes)

This project focuses on:

Analyzing PhonePe’s aggregated transaction and user data.

Mapping state and district-level transaction activities.

Finding top contributors based on different metrics.
